A Hangman Game On Python is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct position. The user has to guess the correct word until a man is hung, then the game is over.
it includes defining functions and managing for/while loops. The functions that I used here contain arguments that are defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game quality. It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon conditions by the for and while loops.
